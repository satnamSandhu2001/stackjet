  - Update and reload NGINX configurations automatically
  - Manage SSL certificates and HTTPS setups
  - Sync DNS records and proxy rules via Cloudflare
  - Trigger deployments via CLI, webhook, or web panel

Whether it's a Spring Boot JAR, a Go binary, Django with Gunicorn, npm scripts or Laravel app with Artisan — Stackjet ensures consistent, reliable deployment every time.`,
